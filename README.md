# AppleSeeds Weekend Assigment 8 - ReactJS Voting Application

This web app mocks a voting campaign and lets a user register/login and vote for a chosen party. After the vote has been made, the user is asked to confirm the vote and log out or realocate their vote.

The project was built in React and uses mockdata located in src/data as initial data. Stores it in localStorage using LocalStoraManager located in src/utils and works with localstorage throughout the whole experience. Please note, the data resets at refresh to its initial state.

## Demo
